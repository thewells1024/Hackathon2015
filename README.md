Hackathon 2015
==============

**GitHub repo for the hackathon**

By Kent Kawahara and Max Zinkus

There are some bugs with pdf generation (too many bullets appear, more than the number of lines).

There is a bug in the form repopulation where the multiline fields become comma-seperated rather than newline seperated.

Also, if you could make project summaries into textareas, that'd be good.

Dependencies (pip)
* Flask
* python-devel
